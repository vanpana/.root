# .root
App developed at Polihack v5

<b>.root</b> is the solution for liniar education by using a tree system so that anyone can progress through a course/tutorial in his own way, creating an unique path.

The tree features nodes that can be of any type, for example, the already implemented ones are:

<b>lecture</b> where you can only read a lesson.

<b>project</b> where you have a deadline to upload a .zip file containing the solution of a task.

Other use cases may be:

<b>teamwork</b> where you are automatically assigned to upload a project developed with team-mates.

<b>test</b> that you can only take one time so that you can be graded for your knowledge.

A feature for the tree is that anyone can add private nodes (only stored and displayed for the creator user, unless it's published). This way, community can grow the lecture/project database. Also, by using a feedback algorithm, if they have positive rating, the nodes can be proposed to be merged into the "official" tree they were originally added to privately.

.root combines education with peer-to-peer concept, so if a user encounters a problem and can't pass a project or a lecture, they click a button and a request is automatically posted to the help board of those who already finished the node. The notified users can give a hint to the ones in need, and based on the feedback recieved by the hint, they may have different advantages.
