Printing from console

In the introductory course, we learned to compile and run our first C program. Now, we will learn how to print user input via console.

How do we read user input from console?

In the standard library there is a function called getline(). Let's see it in action.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char input[100];
    scanf("%s", input);
    printf("%s\n", input);
    return 0;
}

Let's see how all these lines work.

char input[100] - input is a variable. Every variable has a type. Type char means that the variable will store an element of type char (eg.: 'a', '1', '@'). Note: '1' means the character associated with the number 1. [100] means input will store 100 elements of type char.
scanf("%s", input) - scanf() is a function found in the standard library. It reads input from the console and stores it in a given variable. The first parameter it accepts is "%s". "%s" means scanf() will take a variable of type string. input is the second parameter of the function. This is where we will store our input.
printf("%s", input) - Here, printf() has two parameters. When printing a variable, you use it like scanf(). The "\n" after "%s" is a newline character, meaning that the function will print our input on a new line.

If you compile and run the code above, you will see that the input from the console is printed after we press enter.
