Introduction to C

C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, developed by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1972. C is among the most widely used computer languages. C was designed to be portable and to allow low-level access to memory. As such, C will run on a variety of platforms.

Learn how to create and compile your first C program

One of the most famous C programs is one that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Here is the code to do the following:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!");
    return 0;
}

So, what do all these lines do?

#include <stdio.h> - Includes the header for the standard library. This allows you to use the printf function.
int main() - This is the main function of our program. It returns an integer value back to the operating system.
printf("Hello, world!"); - Prints the string "Hello, world!". This is a standard library function.
return 0 - Returns value 0 to the operating system. Usually, a value of 0 means the program ended as expected. A value of -1 might mean that the program has ended unexpectedly.

If you compile and run the code above you will see that it prints "Hello, world!" and that the program has ended and returned value 0. Everything is working as expected!

Congratulations! You have created your first C program. In the following lessons, we will learn to print from the console, from the command line, and from a file.
